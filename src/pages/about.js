                    <p>Hi, my name is Emily and I am website developer from Evergreen, Colorado.</p>
                    <p>I am currently working as a <b>Lead CMS Web Developer</b> at <Link to="https://www.simpleview.com/">Simpleview</Link>, a company that builds marketing websites for DMOs (Destination Marketing Organizations). There, I have worked on over 150 destination websites from hotels sites such as <Link to="https://www.napariverinn.com/">Napa River Inn</Link> to large sites for countries, such as <Link to="https://www.visitnorway.com/">Visit Norway</Link>. Please see my projects page to see just a few of the builds I have been most proud to work on.</p>
                    <p>Outside of work I enjoy relaxing and spening time with my above average dog, Don Rico Suave. He is a mixed bread rescue, and professional begger, who found my family on a Dominican Republic holiday vacation. He now enjoys two homes, enless treats, sleeping under the covers, and working as my service dog.</p>
                    <p>I am also pasionate about helping people with disabilies like me. In highschool I was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a debilitating nerve disease and my muscles started to slowly get weaker. As an athlete it was difficult to come to terms with this new reality. Now, I use a wheelchair to get around -- I can still walk some but it's a struggle. Out of this challenge <Link to="www.magicspaceship.org">Project Magic Spaceship</Link> tookoff. With the help of friends and family I set off to do something too difficult for me to do alone because of my handicap, and this is something I want to help others like me to be able to do.</p>
