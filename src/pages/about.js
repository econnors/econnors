                    <p>Hi, my name is Emily and I am website developer from Evergreen, Colorado.</p>
                    <p>I am currently working as <b>Lead CMS Web Developer</b> at <a href="https://www.simpleview.com/" target="_blank">Simpleview</a>, a company that builds marketing websites for DMOs (Destination Marketing Organizations). At Simpleview, I have worked on over 150 destination websites for clients ranging from small hotels (<a to="https://www.napariverinn.com/" target="_blank">Napa River Inn</a>) to entire countries,  (<a href="https://www.visitnorway.com/" target="_blank">Visit Norway</a>). Please see my projects page for examples of my builds.</p>
                    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy spening time with my above-average dog, Rico, a mixed bread rescue from the Dominican Republic, a former professional begger who now earns his treats as my service dog.</p>
                    <p>I'm also passionate about helping people with disabilities. After a very active and athletic childhood, I was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a debilitating nerve disease, when I was in high school and since then I have struggled with the increasing muscle weakness that SMA entails. Now, I use a wheelchair to get around -- I can still walk some but it's a struggle. However, this challenge has helped steer me to my career as a developer and has spawned ideas like <a href="https://magicspaceship.org/" target="_blank">Project Magic Spaceship</a> a coordinated effort with friends and family that let me accomplish something my disability would never have allowed me to do on my own. I sincerely hope to share that experience with others like me.</p>
